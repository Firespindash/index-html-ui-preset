# index-html-ui-preset
It's a responsive UI planned preset for **index.html** file. Which is usually required by a server when you are coding something in backend, like in *PHP* for example. And [this](https://firespindash.github.io/index-html-ui-preset/) is the live preview! 

## About
It's just a test project that can be used in other projects. It's made for testing backend code, which needs a bit of frontend, like the **index.html** page for instance. To make things more convenient.

## Use License
You can use it for tests, change links, etc. Feel free to use it. \
I recommend you change the logo and the items and links in the navbar to fit your page functions.
For example, you can change one item to "SignUp", or "LogIn", or "Pricing", or "ContactUs", etc. For better experience don't put two words in one item.
### Image
I made the image myself and it's free to use too.
